### Making the dough

1. Sift the flour, yeast and salt into a large mixing bowl.
2. Add warm water a little at a time and manually mix into a dough. If it is too sticky add a little more flour, if too dry add more water. It should have a pliable texture.
3. Turn the dough onto a cold surface and continue to kneed for a few more minutes, dusting with flour from time to time to prevent it sticking to the surface.
4. Fashion it into a ball.
5. Put the dough back into the bowl and cover with Clingfilm (or a damp cloth).
6. Place into a warm place and leave for at least an hour, preferably two.

### Assembling your pizzas

1. Around 50 minutes before you plan to serve put on the oven to 240°C and allow it to heat up fully – it is important that the oven is very hot when you put the pizzas in.
2. At the same time remove the dough from the mixing bowl – which should have trebled in size – and kneed it (adding more flour as necessary as it will now be stickier) on the cold surface.
3. Divide the dough into four equal parts and then make each part into a ball and flatten it.
4. Leave the dough discs to rest for at least 15 minutes. During this time they will rise again a little.
5. While you are waiting prepare the tins by lightly oiling and flouring them – it’ll stop the pizzas from sticking.
6. Drain the mozzarella and chop into small pieces. Always prep more than you need as you might find a few rogue characters pinching the odd chunk if your back is turned!
7. When the dough has rested, roll each disc (keep the flour shaker at hand!) into flat thin sheets and lay in the tins.
8. Spread the tomato/mushroom topping (less is more) and add the mozzarella.
9. Cook in the preheated oven for 13 minutes, but check after 11.
10. Take the pizza out of the oven, slice, and enjoy!
